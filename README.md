# EpisodeTracker
All code experiments and infrastructure necessary to execute the experiments with Episode Tracker made in H.IAAC.

This research is conected to a greater project on **H.IAAC** in *UNICAMP (BR)* of **Knowledge Representation**, using similar code as on the repository [github.com/H-IAAC/TFC-HAR/](https://github.com/H-IAAC/TFC-HAR/).

# Requirements
All the necessary requirements are available on the requirements.txt and can be installed by ``` python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```.

To use the virtual env of python use:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Datasets
This work will use a pair of datasets not produced by our team. This way, code is provided to make them available, but please make sure you follow the LICENSE of the dataset.

To download and setup the datasets use:

```
cd dataset
source ./download_setup.sh

```

# Using this code?
Fell free to use, copy, edit all parts of the code, texts and images on this repository. It also would be nice if you cite this work, me NÃ­colas Hecker, and the H.IAAC at UNICAMP when using this repository ðŸ˜†
